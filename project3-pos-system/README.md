# Final Project: Restaurant Point of Sale System

## 📋 Project Overview

A comprehensive Point of Sale (POS) system designed for restaurant operations, featuring order management, financial analysis, and business intelligence reporting. This project emphasizes modern C++ techniques, modular design practices, and real-world business application development.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

- **Modern C++ Techniques**: STL containers and contemporary programming practices
- **System Integration**: Multi-component business system design
- **Financial Modeling**: Cost analysis and profit calculation algorithms
- **Modular Architecture**: Multi-file project organization and separation of concerns

## 📊 Business Requirements

### Menu Management
The system supports a standard restaurant menu with the following items:
- **Hamburger**
- **Cheeseburger** 
- **Fries**
- **Soda**
- **Milkshake**

### Financial Data Structure
Each menu item maintains:
- **Name**: Item identifier (e.g., "Hamburger")
- **Cost**: Restaurant's cost to prepare the item
- **Sales Price**: Price charged to customers

### Order Processing
- Accept customer orders with multiple items
- Support quantity specification for each item
- Maintain order history for reporting

## 📈 Reporting Capabilities

### Financial Analysis Reports

1. **Total Cost Analysis**
   - Sum of (cost × quantity) for all items sold
   - Restaurant's total operational costs

2. **Revenue Reporting**
   - Sum of (sales price × quantity) for all transactions
   - Total customer payments received

3. **Item-Wise Profit Analysis**
   - Individual profit calculation: (sales price - cost) × quantity
   - Performance analysis by menu item

4. **Store Profit Summary**
   - Overall profitability: Total revenue - Total costs
   - Business performance overview

## 🚀 Building and Running

### Prerequisites
- C++ compiler with C++11 support or later
- STL library support (standard with modern compilers)

### Compilation
```bash
# Navigate to project directory
cd final-pos-system/src

# Compile with STL support
g++ -std=c++11 -Wall -o pos_system *.cpp

# Execute the system
./pos_system
```

## 🧪 Demonstration Requirements

### System Initialization
```cpp
// Initialize menu items with cost and sales price
POSSystem restaurant;
restaurant.addMenuItem(MenuItem("Hamburger", 2.50, 5.99));
restaurant.addMenuItem(MenuItem("Cheeseburger", 2.75, 6.49));
restaurant.addMenuItem(MenuItem("Fries", 0.75, 2.99));
restaurant.addMenuItem(MenuItem("Soda", 0.25, 1.99));
restaurant.addMenuItem(MenuItem("Milkshake", 1.50, 4.99));
```

### Order Processing
```cpp
// Create and process multiple orders
Order order1;
order1.addItem(restaurant.getMenuItem("Hamburger"), 2);
order1.addItem(restaurant.getMenuItem("Fries"), 2);
order1.addItem(restaurant.getMenuItem("Soda"), 3);

restaurant.processOrder(order1);
```

### Report Generation
The system must demonstrate:
- Complete financial analysis for all processed orders
- Item-by-item profit breakdown
- Total store performance metrics
- **No user input required** - all operations are predefined

## 📊 Sample Output Format

```
=== RESTAURANT POS SYSTEM REPORT ===

MENU ITEMS:
Hamburger - Cost: $2.50, Price: $5.99, Profit: $3.49
Cheeseburger - Cost: $2.75, Price: $6.49, Profit: $3.74
...

ORDERS PROCESSED: 3

FINANCIAL SUMMARY:
Total Costs: $45.50
Total Revenue: $128.75
Total Profit: $83.25

ITEM PERFORMANCE:
Hamburger: 5 sold, Profit: $17.45
Cheeseburger: 3 sold, Profit: $11.22
...
```

## 🎯 Technical Requirements

### STL Usage (Mandatory)
- **`vector<>` containers**: Replace all arrays with STL vectors
- **Modern C++ practices**: Leverage STL algorithms where appropriate
- **No manual memory management**: STL handles dynamic allocation

### Operator Overloading
Implement appropriate operators for:
- Order manipulation and combination
- MenuItem comparison and display
- System output formatting

### Modular Design
- **Multiple source files**: Distribute code across logical components
- **Clean interfaces**: Well-defined class boundaries
- **Separation of concerns**: Business logic separate from presentation

## 📈 Grading Criteria

### 1. Design Quality (Major Weight)
- **Modularity**: Clear separation between components
- **Organization**: Logical file structure and class hierarchy
- **Avoid over-engineering**: Balance between simplicity and functionality

### 2. Implementation Correctness
- All financial calculations produce accurate results
- STL containers used appropriately throughout
- System handles multiple orders correctly

### 3. Code Quality
- **Modern C++ techniques**: Effective STL utilization
- **Operator overloading**: Meaningful and intuitive implementations
- **Documentation**: Clear code comments and structure

### 4. Deliverables Completeness
- **Written explanation**: Design approach and decision rationale
- **Source code**: All `.h` and `.cpp` files with modular organization
- **Output demonstration**: Complete functionality showcase in text format

## 🔍 Key Concepts Demonstrated

### STL Mastery
- Vector-based data storage and manipulation
- Container iteration and algorithm usage
- Modern C++ container best practices

### Business Logic Implementation
- Real-world financial modeling and calculation
- Multi-dimensional data analysis (cost, revenue, profit)
- Scalable order processing architecture

### System Design
- Component-based architecture
- Interface design and implementation separation
- Extensible menu and reporting framework

## ⚠️ Important Guidelines

- **No user interaction**: System runs predetermined operations
- **STL mandatory**: Vectors replace all array usage
- **Multi-file structure**: Avoid monolithic main.cpp implementation
- **Complete demonstration**: Show all functionality in execution
